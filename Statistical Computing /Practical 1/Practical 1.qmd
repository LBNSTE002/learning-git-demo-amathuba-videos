# Practical 1

## Question 1

### Find all rows in “airquality” that have missing values

```{r}
missing <- airquality[rowSums(is.na(airquality)) >0, ]

missing
```

## Question 2

### Ozone Summary Statistics

```{r}
mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

sd(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

min(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

max(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Temperature Summary Statistics

```{r}
mean(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)

sd(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)

min(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)

max(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Question 3

### Response Variable (y)

```{r}
Y <- cars$dist
```

### Design Matrix (x)

```{r}
X <- cbind(1, cars$speed)
```

### Parameter Estimates

```{r}
b_hat <- solve( t(X) %*% (X) ) %*% t(X) %*% Y

b_hat
```

## Question 4

### Linear regression model using lm()

```{r}
lm(Y ~ cars$speed)
```
